# VeBp-dataset

# Dataset Description：
A novel dataset for optimal points detection to break vehicle windows.It contains 2,000 vehicle images carefully selected from the VeRi dataset, a large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle Re-Identification in real-world urban surveillance scenarios. All images were accurately annotated by manual visual interpretation. The annotations of break points are stored using txt files, with each image corresponding to one txt file. Each line in the txt file represents a break point, indicated by its x,y coordinates normalized by dividing by the width and height of the image. Among them, 1,500 are used for training the model, and the remaining 500 are used for evaluation.
